# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a system that tracks changes to files over time so that specific version can be recalled later.  It is useful is an error was made and you need to revert back to a previous version to fix the error.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of the master or codebase that will allow you to work on several different things all pertaining to the same code.  Most of the time all of these are different features or ideas that you wish to implement, they may or may not be on the same timeline and may be worked on indpendently of each other.  Each branch can then be merged back to the master or discarded all together. This process keeps code cleaner and and allows for multiple people to be working on the same project.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a save point in your code changes.  A new version is created everytime you commit thus allowing to return to the previous version if needed.  A good commit message is a detailed message about what changes have been made to the code since the last commit or save point.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict happens when you modify two things that try and change the same thing and the algorithm is unable to determine which is correct.
