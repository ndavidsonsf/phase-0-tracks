<!-- The purpose of HTML5 semantics is to create standarization and to make pages more readable and accessible for those with disabilities. I think the heading tasks in decending order are incredible as well as the section tag, it would allow the accessible user to easily navigate the 'sections' of the page. -->
<!-- main, header, nav, section, article, aside, footer -->
<!-- Sublime snippets are amazing, snippets in general are amazing.  I am sure this will not be last snipper for any number of things.  I know in the past I have made some snippets with other IDEs to make life simpler. -->
<!-- I am still a bit confused about the order, all I need to do is spend some more time researching and reading through documenetation.  I have added it to my TODO list for the week. -->
