I will start with a couple simple jquery google searches.  
Look for some quick tutorials, some how to's, and documentation.
Take a look at Codeacademy, even if just a few moments.
Time block ~ 15 minutes, on the second timer, 5 min break (15, 15, 5, 15, 15, 5, 15, 15, 5, 15)
	enough time to get into something and test some new stuff and not get overwhelmed, when timer sounds, move to another topic or another resource.
I like this approach, it allows me to not become overwhelmed.  I also know that videos/tutorials, work best for me otherwise I am unable to see the forest through the trees.
