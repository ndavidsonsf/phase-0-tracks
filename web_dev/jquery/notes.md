I will start with a couple simple jquery google searches.  
Look for some quick tutorials, some how to's, and documentation.
Take a look at Codeacademy, even if just a few moments.
Time box ~ 15 minutes, on the second timer, 5 min break (15, 15, 5, 15, 15, 5, 15, 15, 5, 15)
	enough time to get into something and test some new stuff and not get overwhelmed, when timer sounds, move to another topic or another resource.
I like this approach, it allows me to not become overwhelmed.  I also know that videos/tutorials, work best for me otherwise I am unable to see the forest through the trees.


Ok, so time boxing did not work as well as I wanted to.  I still ended up researching for nearly 3.5hrs.  I feel like this clicked a lot easier than the manual changes we were making to the DOM, or that could just be that now this was my second time looking at it.

I know that I should spend more time on the thing we are supposed to create, but I feel as though my extra time studying counts for something.  I am going to use my personal page, located at ndavidsonsf.github.io and just add something to that.
